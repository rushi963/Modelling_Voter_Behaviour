# Modelling Voter Behaviour and Electoral Dynamics using Cellular Automata

The goal of the project is to study models which are able to capture voting behaviour and observe the long term emergent behaviour of the entire voting system. This is a fairly complicated problem to tackle. Initially we built models based on simple rules and binary states and slowly developed them using more complicated rules and introducing variety in the states of the agents. The problem has elements which dynamically evolve with time so the simulation technique in this case is cellular automation. We tried mimicking the real world situation by introducing:

1. Effect of Mass Media
2. Effect of Radicals
3. Tri-party system
